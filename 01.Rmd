## To set a good price, first understand value.

Every effective modern organization uses software.  Vendors create software so they can sell it to organizations in often complex and unique deals.  Price is the point of connection between organizations and vendors, or generically between supply and demand, that enables an exchange of value.  Of the four main growth levers, pricing is the most levered.  Research by McKinsey demonstrated that a typical S&P 1500 firm can improve profit by 8% by improving price by 1%.  https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-power-of-pricing

Pricing well enables a firm to improve accessibility of its product for various customer segments and to maximize value capture for each segment.  Both of these increase top line revenue. Price is now very interesting, so let's explore a bit.  In theory, an entity is willing to pay up to the value of the utility received from software for that software.  In practice, the total cost of using software is not limited to paying the vendor, and utility received is distributed and difficult to measure.  

The problem faced by firms is how to improve pricing in a systematic, customer-centric manner.

## The pricing solution proposed.

The practical solution for pricing better across a B2B software business is deploying a model that gets close to the pin cheaply and quickly.  In other words, to accelerate growth, B2B software firms can deploy a pricing capability that enables users to predict a good price range for each potential deal, instantly or nearly so.

A pricing and discounting model requires The data foundation of a B2B software pricing model depends on the variety and quality of data available, and the frequency of model updates depends on operational capability, but the common constant is using data to gain insight into demand.  A few easy classifiers to use in segmentation include customer, market, and product.  To use a non-B2B example familiar to all MIDS students, UC Berkeley educates full-time on campus students and part-time remote students (customer), caters to a local market and an international market (market), and offers undergraduate product, master product, and doctorate product (product). B2B busiensses typically retain these three types of data in generally reliable quality in a CRM tool. 

These types of data and others will blended to train a model aimed at predicting good discounts for any given deal within the scope of the model.  Since our objective function is business optimization, as opposed to model optimization, deployability is a key requirement.  A neural network or random forest might optimize accuracy, but a simpler tree, regression, or a combination might get close enough and also be feasibly productionalized.  Again, if a 1% improvement in price yields an 8% increase in profit, on average, then a light model with a high chance of achieving 1% price improvement is much preferred to a heavy model with a medium chance of achieving 5%.  The risk/reward balance is key.

Once built, the model would need to be deployed into the existing sales and deal negotiation process, and may be used by sales teams, sales management, deal desks, product groups, marketing among others.  The primary purpose is to quickly and cheaply guide pricing where the next best alternative is tribal knowledge and back of the napkin math.  Once deployed, other organizations benefit by gaining a deeper understanding of demand faced by the firm.

## so what?.

Pricing is cool because it helps firms access and serve more customers, maximize the utility its products generate, and do a better job translating utility generated into revenue.  Secondarily, this model helps convey a common standard of demand and product value across the firm, often forcing cross-functional communication about serving customers that otherwise might not occur.  In other words, in addition to improving the top line in the short term, a well constructed pricing function forces a firm to be aligned and focused on creating customer value, which improves long term profitability.
